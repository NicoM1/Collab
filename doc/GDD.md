(This is getting messy. We should adopt a structed document base or switch to the wiki.)

### Setting (@Eiyeron's ideas)
I have some ideas about setting it into a steapunk universe. Not so original but it has an advantage : we can set there the gun mania without getting plot holes.

The world had an technology boom with the industrial revolution. New transportations are made of the steel made from the iron and the other resources coming straight from under our feet and

Scientists around the world keep getting hired by ever-growing companies. THe success of the first or the fastest to hire and get the new technological discoveries get too envied to keep this steam and race peacefully. Now entrepreneurs hire men from the shadows to steal the scientific works or just to sink their rivals. You're one of the mercenary from the shadows.

And yes, it's pretty much TF2 with some tweaks. I'm writing theses idea as they come and I surely played too much Steam games... ><

###Game mechanics ideas
- ProcGen Terrain
  - (@Eiyeron) If it's a space shmup (hello, originality), Proc gen could be used to design planets as KSP (Kerbal Space Program) does or a lot of procgen games (like roguelikes)
  - (@Eiyeron) The main advantage with using pseudo-random functionbs like Simplex is the lossless details. Just add on the fly more octaves / calculation passses and you'll have as much details as you want.
  - (@Eiyeron) I should have some old prototypes here and there. I could bring them up for dissection.
-(@NicoM1 ideas)
  - weapon aim goes left/right/up/down but not back/front (y axis)
  - levels scroll to the right, sometimes with gate blocking the path until actions are completed
  - small enemies swarm like a shmup but with a smaller amount
  - large bosses occur at specific times
